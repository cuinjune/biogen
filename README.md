# biogen
A biography generator

## Description
This repo is the assignment of the Reading and Writing Electronic Text course at ITP.  
The assignment was to write a program that produces texts that emulate a particular form or genre of language.  
I created a program that generates a biography-like texts based on the book [My Life and Work by Samuel Crowther and Henry Ford](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7213).

## Example Result

Also, He can speak eight languages including English.
Gilbert continues to pay annual shops.
